# k

An IRC bot that lives mainly on the `#bots`, `#team` and `#meta`
channels of the `irc.tilde.chat` IRC network.

Not directly useful; but currently provides some basic utilities
to get statistics for various channels.

## faq
- **Q**: why does this implement features already present in BitBot?
	- **A**: so that I can use this on servers/channels without
	BitBot.
