# sigsegv

An IRC bot that lives mainly on the `#bots`, `#team` and `#chaos`
channels of the `irc.tilde.chat` IRC network.

## faq
- **Q**: why does this implement features already present in other bots?
	- **A**: so that I can use this on servers/channels without
	those bots.

The code has more differences than similarities by now,
though.
